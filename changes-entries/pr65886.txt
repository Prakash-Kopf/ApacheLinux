  *) mod_proxy: Use the maxium of front end and backend timeouts instead of the
     minimum when tunneling requests (websockets, CONNECT requests).
     Backend timeouts can be configured more selectively (per worker if needed)
     as front end timeouts and typically the backend timeouts reflect the
     application requirements better.  PR 65886 [Ruediger Pluem]
