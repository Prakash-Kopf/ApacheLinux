  * core/mod_proxy/mod_ssl:
    Adding `outgoing` flag to conn_rec, indicating a connection is
    initiated by the server to somewhere, in contrast to incoming
    connections from clients.
    Adding 'ap_ssl_bind_outgoing()` function that marks a connection
    as outgoing and is used by mod_proxy instead of the previous
    optional function `ssl_engine_set`. This enables other SSL
    module to secure proxy connections.
    The optional functions `ssl_engine_set`, `ssl_engine_disable` and
    `ssl_proxy_enable` are now provided by the core to have backward
    compatibility with non-httpd modules that might use them. mod_ssl
    itself no longer registers these functions, but keeps them in its
    header for backward compatibility.
    The core provided optional function wrap any registered function
    like it was done for `ssl_is_ssl`.
