  *) mod_http: separating the HTTP semantic handling from the HTTP/1.x
     serialization (transcoding) handling by splitting filters.
     - new HEADERS bucket type that carries an optional status code
       and reason string, optional headers and notes tables.
       TRANSCODE filters are converting protocol version specific
       input to HEADERS buckets. And HEADERS output buckets into
       the wire format for the headers.
     - new module mod_http1 that has the new transcoding filters.
       also linked statically, just like mod_http.
     - "chunked" encoding handled in mod_http1 TRANSCODE filters.
     - Response header check and completion done in mod_http
       filter for all HTTP procotol versions.
     - ap_send_interim_response() now generates a HEADERS bucket
       and sends it through the protocol output filters of a request.
     - there are still several code locations in the server where

     "Transfer-Encoding" headers are checked to determine if
     a request has a body in absence of a "Content-Length". This
     does not hold for HTTP/2. A AP_NOTE_HTTP_REQUEST_BODY can
     be set in r->notes to "1" to override this, but not all
     checks have been adjusted so far. ongoing.
