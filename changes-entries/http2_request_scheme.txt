  *) mod_http2: :scheme pseudo-header values, not matching the
     connection scheme, are forwarded via absolute uris to the
     http protocol processing to preserve semantics of the request.
     Checks on combinations of pseudo-headers values/absence
     have been added as described in RFC 7540.
     Fixes <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/230>.
