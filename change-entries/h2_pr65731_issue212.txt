  *) mod_http2: fixes 2 regressions in server limit handling.
     1. When reaching server limits, such as MaxRequestsPerChild, the
        HTTP/2 connection send a GOAWAY frame much too early on new
        connections, leading to invalid protocol state and a client
        failing the request. See PR65731.
        The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and
        allows the client to submit one request before the shutdown
        via a GOAWAY frame is being announced.
     2. A regression in v1.15.24 was fixed that could lead to httpd
        child processes not being terminated on a graceful reload or
        when reaching MaxConnectionsPerChild. When unprocessed h2
        requests were queued at the time, these could stall.
